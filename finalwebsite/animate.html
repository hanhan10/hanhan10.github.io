        Animation was my favorite section of this class. It's where my career interests lie, so I was really interested in learning more about it. I've experienced working in 3D animation but never 2D and I couldn't believe how easy it was to use and yet how amazing of a result you can end up with. Adobe Animate reminded me of video editing so I found it a lot easier to use. I can't wait to continue learning more about animation in future courses!
