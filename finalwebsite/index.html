            I was very excited to take VMD 105 because I am interested in 2D animation and felt like this class was a great introductory. I have worked in the creative arts for many years, but my abilities fall in dancing, film, and fine arts. This class was a challenge to me because it had me using programs I'd never even known about. It was exciting to see that although I'm still starting out, there is so much that is possible to create and not as difficult or impossible as it may have seemed before. Within this course, I gravitated to the more creative and drawing based sections like animation and illustrator. I look forward to learning more about making hand drawn characters come to life through the computer!
