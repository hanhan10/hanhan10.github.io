            Although I ran out of time in this section, I really enjoyed learning Illustrator. Even though it's a computer program, it felt most similar to drawing for me. I enjoyed learning about the different tools and how to bring a drawn image into the program and turn it into a digital character. This image is a play off of Edna Mode from the Incredibles. Because of the time constraint, I went with a familiar character and changed aspects to try and make her a bit more original. I felt that this character captured the essence of Edna, especially the facial expression and her stance. I hope to learn more about Illustrator in the future.
